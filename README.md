## Abstract 

Prior to the beginning of the 2022-2023 school year there was a focus by the executive team  at Foundation Academy on leveraging data and creating a data-driven culture to ensure the best possible academic and operational outcomes for staff and students. There was a complete restructuring of data maintenance, data analysis, and data sharing processes to make data insights more comprehensive, aesthetically appealing, and accessible to key stakeholders throughout the organization.

As the Data and Assessment Manager I was tasked with implementing changes to contribute to the improvement of the organization’s overall data culture at Foundation Academy. The main catalyst in approving data culture, specifically data literacy and accessibility, was the creation of a specialized tableau workbook shared on Tableau Online relative to a stakeholder’s role that is updated on a schedule.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of my performance as a Data and Assessment Manager at Foundation Academy in attributing to the improvement of the organization’s data culture, primarily data accessibility.Efficacy of my performance as Data and Assessment Manager will be evaluated via number the of views of the specialized tableau workbooks created during the 2022-2023 school year compared to the number of views of the data visualizations created during the 2021-2022 school year.

The analysis will be guided by the following questions:

1. Was there an increase in the number of views of specialized tableau workbooks created during the 2022-2023 school year compared to the number of views of data visualizations created during 2021-2022 school year?
2. What was the most popular data specialized tableau workbook during the 2022-2023 school year?
3. What was the overall trend in the staff’s interaction with the specialized tableau workbooks during the 2022-2023 school year?

Yes, there was an increase in the number of views of the specialized tableau workbooks compared to the number of views of the data visualizations from the 2021-2022 school year to the 2022-2023 school year. During the 2021-2022 school year there were a total of 588 views. Comparatively there were 1,062 views during the 2022-2023 school year, a 81% increase in views year over year from the 2021-2022 school year to the 2022-2023 school year. Additionally, interactions with data visualizations during the 2021-2022 school year increased by an average of 2 views, 311%, month over month. While interactions with the specialized tableau workbooks during the 2022-2023 school year increased by an average of 19 views, 244%, month over month.

The Principal Viz was the most viewed specialized tableau workbook, accounting for 322 (30%) of views, during the 2022-2023 school year. This is most likely due to the Principal Viz being the most frequently refreshed data visualization with updates being made weekly and containing key data insights, e.g. attendance, incidents, academic data, and more, that inform academic performance and operational performance.
